      Heating your home can be overlooked until your heating system fails or
      your electricity bill increases rapidly. Heating systems become major
      problems if they are not working properly. While it is important to
      provide adequate heat in your homes, keeping costs down is also
      critical. If you are looking for a new heating system or would like to
      learn more about direct heat, this article is for you. We will discuss
      the advantages and disadvantages of various types of direct heating
      systems to help you determine which may be right for you.

      <b>Direct heat comes usually in the form of a space heater and acts as a
        supplementary heat source. Some homes, however, use direct heating
        systems for their entire house. This type of heating system is very
        easy to install, but it is more expensive to operate than a central
        heating system.</b>

    <h2>What Is a Direct Heater?</h2>
    <p>
      Direct heaters heat air that passes through an open flame, and
      components in these systems control the warmed air. Direct heating
      systems are effective in areas with less insulation or large amounts of
      warm air.
    </p>
    <p>There are many advantages to direct heating systems:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        They are very efficient as 100% of the combustion gases are used to
        heat the air.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of these systems can operate in temperatures as low as -30
        degrees Fahrenheit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Direct heaters are less expensive to purchase, rent, and maintain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simple components make up these heaters making them very easy to
        transport.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even small direct heaters produce high amounts of heat, and many have
        built-in thermostats.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some disadvantages of direct heaters include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        An inability to be used in tightly sealed spaces or near flammable
        items
      </li>
      <li>
        Heating spaces must have a type of window, door, or other air exchange
        to open.
      </li>
      <li>In some cases, these systems do not always create dry heat.</li>
      <li>
        Exhaust and fumes produced are some of the combustion byproducts.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="gas-heater">
    <h2>Gas Space Heaters Explained</h2>
    <p>
      Natural gas and propane space heaters are mostly used in garages,
      basements, and outdoor spaces converted into rooms. Systems like
      wall-mounted, free-standing, and floor furnaces have a lack of ductwork
      and do not produce very much heat. Due to a lack of ducts, gas space
      heaters are most useful in heating a single room. To heat multiple rooms
      with this type of system, doors must be left open between rooms. The
      most advanced systems use sealed combustion air systems with installed
      pipes to provide combustion air and carry off combustion products. Gas
      space heaters are most appropriate for buildings like cabins in which
      large temperature differences between rooms are acceptable. Most models
      use natural gas or propane while some burn kerosene.
    </p>
    <p>Some advantages to these systems include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Natural gas and propane are cheaper than electricity so these heaters
        are more economical.
      </li>
      <li>
        These space heaters provide immediate heat and come equipped with a
        thermostat to maintain a constant temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Disadvantages include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Systems must be vented to the outside to avoid carbon monoxide leaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Installation is more complicated than with other direct heating
        systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gas-fueled space heaters also lack cool-touch grilles like electric
        space heaters have, so children and pets must be kept away.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Unvented gas-fired space heaters have many health and safety risks.
      These systems are only safe if a nearby window is kept open but this
      defeats the purpose of the heating system itself. The safety risks
      include exposure to combustion by-products and oxygen depletion. Many
      states prohibit the use of these heaters in homes, and other U.S. cities
      have banned them as well.
    </p>

  <div class="space-heater">
    <h2>Electric Space Heaters Explained</h2>
    <p>
      Portable electric space heaters may be inexpensive to buy but they are
      costly to utilize. Electric current is converted from the wall socket
      directly into heat. It takes much more electricity than natural gas or
      oil to deliver the same amount of useful heat. Electric resistance heat
      is generally the most expensive form of heat and rarely recommended.
      However, these systems are readily available in stores and only require
      a power outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electric baseboard heat is another type of resistive heating, and it is
      hard-wired. Its installation cost is low and individual thermostats can
      be installed in each room to easily turn the heat down. Unless your home
      is extremely insulated, the operating costs for these systems are very
      high.
    </p>
    <p>Some advantages of electric space heaters include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        They come in various styles such as fan, ceramic, and radiator-style
        heaters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Regardless of how much money you have to spend, there will be an
        electric space heater that fits into your budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        Electric space heaters have safety features like cool-touch grilles
        and tip sensors that will shut off the system if it is tipped over.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Disadvantages of electric space heaters include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        They use a great deal of power which will increase your electricity
        bill.
      </li>
      <li>
        The oil-filled radiator style heaters are not very portable and tend
        to be more expensive than the smaller electric space heaters.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <div class="wood-stoves">
    <h2>Wood and Pellet Stoves Explained</h2>
    <p>
      In rural areas, wood and pellet heating may make sense. Stacking wood
      and stoking the stove or furnace would be necessary tasks with this type
      of heating. Wood prices are usually lower than oil, gas, or electricity.
      Therefore, if you cut your own, savings can be high. However, there are
      regulations governing pollution emissions from wood stoves as wood
      pollutants have become a major problem in the U.S. Consequently, new
      models of stoves are clean-burning. Pellet stoves are less polluting
      than wood stoves and give users greater convenience, temperature
      control, and indoor air quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wood stove technology has come a long way and EPA-certified stoves are
      efficient and burn cleanly. This results in making far less of an impact
      on the environment.
    </p>
    <p>Some advantages of wood and pellet stoves include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The fuel being inexpensive and renewable</li>
      <li>
        The EPAâ€™s wood stove certification program makes it easier to find
        clean-burning stoves.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are very eco-friendly stoves with catalytic converters for the
        most environmentally friendly option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pellet stoves offer more options than wood stoves and are generally
        more eco-friendly as well.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some disadvantages to these types of stoves are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        They must be vented to the outdoors, so installation may involve
        construction which is time consuming.
      </li>
      <li>You may need a dry, covered spot to store fuel for the stove.</li>
      <li>
        If wood is the source of fuel, significant storage space may be needed
        to use the wood stove daily.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <div class="fireplaces">
    <h2>Fireplaces Explained</h2>
    <p>
      Gas and wood fireplaces are usually a part of home decor. However, they
      are not usually an effective heating system. They rely on air drawn from
      the room into the fireplace for combustion and dilution. This results in
      a greater heat loss than heat gain as so much warm air is drawn through
      the unit and has to be replaced by colder air outside. If the fireplace
      has a tight-sealing glass door, an outside air source, and good chimney
      damper, it can provide effective heat to a home.
