          Choosing the right heating fuel is a cruical decision. This is
          especially true in the northeast. With cold winters, heat is often the
          largest line-item in a household’s annual budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this guide, we put popular heating fuels head to head: natural gas
          vs. propane vs.
          <a href="blog/heating-oil-deliveries/2-heating-oil-2/">heating oil</a>
          vs. electric. Armed with this information, you can weigh the pros and
          cons to choose the right fuel for your home.

        <h2>Heating Fuel Selection Criteria</h2>
        <hr />
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost:</strong>
              Annual fuel cost, installation cost, annual maintenance cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reliability:</strong> If your provider has a problem, what
              are your alternatives?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety:</strong> Does the fuel pose any significant
              dangers for your family?
            </li>
          </ul>

  <h2>Cost</h2>
  <hr />
  <div class="elementor-widget-container">
    <p>
      The relevant cost comparison depends on your situation: Are you buying a
      home with an existing system? Building a new home? Replacing an aging
      heating system?
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Buying a new home</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      When you’re buying a home with a relatively new heating system, the
      important costs to consider are fuel and maintenance.

  <h2>Building a home or replacing a heating system</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      When you’re building a new home or replacing a heating system that has
      reached the end of its serviceable life, along with the future cost of
      fuel and maintenance, the price of installing the system needs to be
      incorporated into your cost calculations.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Reliability</h2>
  <hr />
  <div>
    <p>
      When it comes to heating your home in the winter, your heating system is
      “mission critical,” so reliability needs to play a major role in selecting
      a heating fuel.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>On-hand Fuel</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Home heating oil &amp; propane:</strong>
      Homes heating with oil and propane have weeks or even months of energy
      on-site at your residence. Even the smallest heating oil tank size, 275
      gallons,
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Natural gas &amp; electric:</strong> Homes heated with natural gas
      or electricity do not store any fuel on-site. A pipeline or power grid
      outage results in immediate loss of heat and hot water for your home.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Alternate Providers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Home heating oil &amp; propane:</strong>
      Each neighborhood has multiple, competing home heating oil and propane
      delivery companies. If your primary provider is unable to deliver, there
      are multiple alternative providers at your service.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Natural gas &amp; electric:</strong> Natural gas and electric
      utilities are monopolies. There is only a single provider for each energy
      source. Homes heated with natural gas or electricity are at the mercy of a
      lone provider with a single distribution system: in a winter storm, if
      your home is heated with electricity or gas, and the electric grid or gas
      pipeline goes down, you will freeze.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Safety</h2>
  <hr />
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Natural gas:</strong>
        Natural gas incidents in the past three years have caused an average of
        $976M dollars (<a
          href="https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/analytics/saw.dll"
          target="_blank"
          >Pipeline &amp; Hazardous Materials Safety Administration</a
        >, US Department of Transportation). In The Atlantic, Nicholas Kawa, a
        former leak detection engineer at a natural gas utility, writes that,
        when he went out to search for leaks, “he could find up to three leaks
        in a given residential yard,” and that “the bulk of gas leaks identified
        are left leaking (“<a
          href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/gas-leaks-are-everywhere/405820/"
          >Gas leaks can’t be tamed</a
        >,” The Atlantic).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Propane:</strong> According to the Fireman’s Association of New
        York, fire departments are dispatched to more than 8,600 propane tank
        explosions every year (<a
          href="https://fasny.com/news/learn-keep-propane-grill-exploding/"
          >Fireman’s Association of New York</a
        >).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heating oil:</strong> Home heating oil is not flammable and it’s
        not stored under pressure. Storage of heating oil in your home poses no
        life-threatening risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electricity:</strong> Electric home heating poses no health
        risks over and above the standard risk of a home being wired with
        electricity.
