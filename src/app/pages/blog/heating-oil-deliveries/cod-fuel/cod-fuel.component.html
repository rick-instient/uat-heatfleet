  <h2>COD Fuel Dealers</h2>
  <h2>
    a.k.a. "Discount Heating Oil Companies" and "Cash Heating Oil Dealers"
  </h2>
  <p>
    Discount heating oil companies, a.k.a “COD Fuel” dealers or “<a
      routerLink="/blog/heating-oil-deliveries/cash-heating-oil"
      >Cash Heating Oil</a
    >” dealers, are the low-fare, no-frills airlines of the home heating oil
    industry. In the same way that JetBlue offers the best prices by eliminating
    frills such as free meals and checked luggage, discount oil companies offer
    the best prices by focusing on a single goal: high quality heating oil
    delivered promptly and professionally.

  <h2>"Will Call" Ordering</h2>
  <hr />
  <div>
    <p>
      When making the switch from a full-price oil delivery company to a
      discount oil delivery company, the biggest difference is the ordering
      process. If you have been using a full-price oil company, after signing a
      1-year delivery agreement, you basically forget about your heating system.
      With a discount heating oil company, just as you fill up your car when you
      run low on gas, you place an oil order when you run low on oil. This type
      of on-demand delivery is sometimes called “will-call.” Switching to a
      discount/COD fuel company can save you hundreds of dollars a year on your
      home heating bills.

      Checking your tank’s oil level is easy: your
      <a routerLink="/blog/oil-central-heating/oil-tank-gauge"
        >oil tank gauge</a
      >
      works just like your car’s fuel gauge. When you see your oil level running
      low, either call a few local discount oil delivery companies to get price
      quotes, or use an online heating oil markteplace like
      <a href="https://heatfleet.com/" target="_blank">HeatFleet.com</a>
      to check price quotes and place an order from your smartphone or computer.

  <h2>Do "Discount" oil companies offer high quality fuel?</h2>
  <hr />
  <div>
    All heating oil delivery companies buy oil from the same fuel terminals, and
    deliver the same
    <a routerLink="/blog/heating-oil-deliveries/2-heating-oil-2"
      >#2 heating oil</a
    >
    that meets the same rigorous quality standards set by each state government.
  </div>

  <h2>What does "COD" mean?</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    The acronym “C.O.D.” stands for Collect On Delivery, a historical reference
    to when discount oil customers paid made payments directly to the oil
    delivery driver. Today, discount oil companies accept credit cards at the
    time you place the order, eliminating the need to be home for your oil
    delivery.
