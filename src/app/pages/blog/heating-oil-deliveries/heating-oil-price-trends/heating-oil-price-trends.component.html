    <div>
      <p>There are a variety of factors that affect heating oil prices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Seasonal demand for heating oil – </strong>all else equal,
          heating oil prices rise in colder months as demand for home heating
          rises. The typical heating oil user in the Northeast consumes 850-1200
          gallons of heating oil a year but the majority of that is during the
          winter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost of crude oil </strong>– crude oil price is the major
          component of heating oil price, as heating oil is made by refining
          crude oil. World supply and demand determines the price of crude oil,
          which means any range of happenings (weather, geopolitical events, oil
          discoveries) can influence its price. Furthermore, groups like the
          Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also play a
          major role in setting prices by coordinating supply.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local market competition –&nbsp;</strong>the number of heating
          oil suppliers can vary region to region and affect the price
          competition in that area. Heating oil and related services’ prices
          tend to be higher when there are fewer suppliers compared to regions
          with more competition. This means consumers in harder-to-reach
          regions, such as rural areas, often end up paying more for heating
          oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regional operating costs – </strong>the cost of supplying
          heating oil to homes can affect prices substantially. If your home,
          neighborhood, or town is hard to reach from traditional oil supply
          stations, you might end up paying more than consumers who live closer.

  <h2>Why do heating oil prices suddenly spike?</h2>
  <hr />
  <div>
    <p>
      Weather phenomena, such as an especially cold winter storm, can cause
      people to want more fuel for their homes or cause people to use heating
      oil faster than they intended. This drives heating oil prices up – even
      more so if the weather causes delivery systems to be delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unexpected increases in consumption for whatever reason generally lead to
      heating oil prices spiking. When wholesale buyers worry that they might
      not have enough supply for their customers’ demand, they bid up the price
      of heating oil and therefore sell it for much higher prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In periods where supply has dipped sharply, heating oil must be shipped in
      from other parts of the world, like the Middle East or Europe. This
      delivery can be expensive and take extended periods of time. In this time,
      uncertainty about short term supply increases which drives middlemen and
      consumers to bid up prices.&nbsp;(

  <h3><b>Will-Call or Automatic Heating Oil Delivery</b></h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      You can’t control the price of heating oil itself, but you can control
      another factor that plays a big role in the price oil – will-call vs
      automatic heating oil delivery. Automatic delivery is a premium service
      and is billed at a higher price – usually a 50 cent upcharge but can be up
      to $1.00. This is because automatic delivery providers monitor your usage
      algorithmically and ensure you never run out of oil. You cannot “time” the
      market if you have automatic delivery, instead paying whatever price the
      heating oil provider charges the day they choose to deliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can take advantage of savings on heating oil by buying the oil
      yourself on a will-call basis and trying to buy oil when you feel the
      price is reasonable for your budget and finances.
      <a href="https://heatfleet.com">HeatFleet</a> gives you the advantage of
      having dealers quote the best prices for you so you always get the

  <h3><b>When should I buy heating oil? </b></h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that if you want to buy oil when prices tend to be
      the lowest, it’s in your best interest to order in the off-season. This
      generally means the summer months.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn’t always true – as mentioned before, heating oil prices depend on
      factors that stretch beyond just seasonal factors. However, more times
      than not, ordering in the off season will save you money throughout the
      winter. Seasonal demand for heating oil peaks from
      <b>late September through April</b>, so ordering outside of that window is
      optimal.
