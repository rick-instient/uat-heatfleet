    Heating Oil Tank Replacement, Installation, and Repair | What You Need to

  <h2>Oil Tank Installation</h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>Oil Tank Sizes</h3>

  <div>
    The first thing to consider when looking at oil tank replacement or
    installing a new oil tank is the size you need. There are two major factors
    in this decision: consumption rate and reliability of supply. There are
    issues with choosing the wrong size. For example, when an installed or
    replaced tank is too small, the furnace could run dry. This leads to
    equipment damage and can result in ineffective heating through cold periods.
    Because of this, securing a reliable supply is important to ensure you don’t
    go days without heating. When negotiating supply, make sure to include
    provisions for regular maintenance. That way, you avoid having wasted fuel.
    It is good to maintain at least a quarter of a tank worth of fuel at all
    times. To read more about checking how much fuel you have, read

    <h3><span>Oil Tank Types</span></h3>
    <span
      >The type of oil tank you have influences the issues you might face
      maintaining or replacing it. There are various types of oil tanks: plastic
      vs. steel tanks, indoor vs. outdoor vs. underground tanks. Even the
      layering can be variable – there are single-skin, double skin and bunded
      tanks. A bunded tank means a tank within another, slightly larger tank.
      The complexity of tank categories means it is best to enlist the help of
      an expert to replace or maintain it.</span

  <h2>Oil Tank Maintenance</h2>
  <hr />

  <div>
    <span
      >For above-ground tanks, there are several recommended maintenance
      tanks.</span
    >
    <h3><span>Check Integrity</span></h3>
    <span
      >Make sure tank legs are not eroded, bent, or rusted, and the leg brackets
      aren’t cracked or detached. Verify the structural integrity of the tank’s
      platform as well.</span
    >

    <span
      >Touch the tank and its connectors to detect rust or deformities, as well
      as around the drain. Any black coloring on the tank likely means there is
      water leaking into it. If you see darkening, check the connecting pipes
      for drips. Similarly, check the filters and valves.</span
    >
    <span
      >Any of these signs mean you should call a professional for oil tank
      maintenance or oil tank replacement.</span
    >
    <h3><span>Check Control Mechanisms</span></h3>
    <span
      >If the tank is operating properly, the vent whistle should make noises
      while the tank is being filled. The oil tank gauge will reflect increasing
      levels as the oil is used up. If the gauge is cracked or loose, call a
      professional to take a look at your system. Again, you could be looking at
      oil tank replacement.</span
    >
    <h3><span>Oil Tank Protection</span></h3>
    <span
      >An outdoor tank should be protected from strong winds and heavy
      precipitation. Clear the area of nearby trees so branches don’t crush the
      tank. The tank should be fenced off to avoid damaging hardware such as
      lawnmowers accidentally running over it. The screens on the tank’s vents
      are extremely important – make sure they aren’t damaged or missing.</span
    >

    <span
      >An underground tank is harder to check yourself – this is why it is
      important to have covenants with your heating oil supply company to
      include maintenance. Just because an aboveground tank is easier to check
      doesn’t mean you don’t need maintenance, as expert eyes make sure you
      don’t accidentally miss something..</span
    >

    <span
      >Having additional maintenance might increase the expense of your
      contract, but is still financially worth it in the long run. Oil tank
      repair can be expensive. Oil tank replacement is even more costly. Making
      sure your oil tank is maintained by yourself and a professional saves you
      the large expense of your oil tank replacement caused by failure.</span
    >
    <h3><span>Oil Tank Cleaning</span></h3>
    <span
      >Pollutants naturally build up in tanks, leading to condensation forming
      on the inside of tanks and water getting trapped. The oil in your tank
      sits on top of the water build up (as oil floats on water) and cleaning is
      imperative to resolve this issue. The water, over time, will corrode your
      tank and require oil tank replacement.</span
    >

    <span
      >Tank corrosion are primarily bad because they cause leaks. Sludge settles
      in the bottom of the tank. This sludge can be piped out from the outlet
      pipe and make its way to your furnace. The mixture of metal and water
      damages furnaces and blocks your filters and valves. All of these increase
      repair costs and could even lead to oil tank replacement.</span
    >

    <span
      >It is important to get your oil tank cleaned regularly. Cleaning should
      occur around once every five years – the process can be convoluted since
      the contents of the tank need to be pumped out. This task can generally be
      carried out by your oil provider.&nbsp;</span
