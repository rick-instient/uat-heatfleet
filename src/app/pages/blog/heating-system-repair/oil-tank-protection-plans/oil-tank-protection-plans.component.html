    <h2>What is Oil Tank Protection?</h2>
    <hr />
    <div>
      <p>
        Oil tank protection or insurance that covers you if
        <a routerLink="/blog/heating-system-repair/oil-tank-leak-repair/"
          >your tank has a leak</a
        >. Usually, this insurance covers the rupture’s cost no matter the
        cause.
      </p>
      <p>Oil tank insurance comes by many names, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Leak protection:&nbsp;</strong>Oil tank leaks can be costly
          and demanding both in terms of labor and money. Insurance gets rid of
          the monetary hassle and covers the expenses on cleaning the mess.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repair coverage:</strong>&nbsp;Oil tanks could warrant repair
          for a variety of reasons. Whether your tank is above or below ground,
          repair coverage guarantees that the bill you get from a contractor for
          fixing the structure of your tank will be covered by the insurance
          company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Replacement coverage:</strong>&nbsp;If the damage to your tank
          extends beyond the point of repair, oil tank insurance will cover the
          cost of a&nbsp;new tank. Regardless of the size or positioning of your
          current tank, you can have its value insured for the price of a
          similar model in case the need should ever arise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Property coverage:</strong>&nbsp;Depending on the terms of a
          given policy, oil tank insurance can cover the cost of damage
          inflicted on property adjacent to a leaky oil tank. Moreover, oil tank
          insurance can cover the cost of cleanup and re-soiling on locations
          where underground leaks have infected the soil.

    <h2>How Does Oil Tank Protection Work?</h2>
    <hr />
    <div>
      <p>
        The process of filing an oil tank insurance claim is much the same as
        with any other insurance policy. When you discover a leak, you report
        the issue and arrange an inspection to assess the damage. Then, you file
        your claim and secure your coverage for the repairs in question. First,
        however, you must choose an insurance plan. Here are the steps:
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like with any other type of insurance, you file a report after
        discovering an oil tank leak and have a professional from the insurance
        company assess the damage. However, before all of that comes choosing a
        plan itself. There are multiple steps in the process:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose a plan:</strong>&nbsp;Look at the plans for oil leaks
          offered by your homeowner’s insurance company. Then, choose a plan
          that makes sense based on the size of your house, your current plan,
          and the size of your oil tank.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pay a moderate monthly or annual fee:</strong>&nbsp;Just like
          with any other insurance policy, you will have to pay a fee to keep
          the policy active either monthly or on an annual basis. The fees could
          be flexible based on your provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Report any leak or accident to the insurer:</strong
          >&nbsp;First, write your own account of the damage of the tank and how
          you’ve assessed the severity of the leakage. Then, report the issue as
          quickly as possible to the proper authorities, including your
          insurance provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact an oil-tank repair company:</strong>&nbsp;Call a
          trusted tank repair service (could be your oil provider itself). After
          giving them your rundown on the leak, arrange for them to come and
          inspect the leak themselves for further action.
        </li>

    <h2>Benefits of Oil Tank Protection</h2>
    <hr />

            alt="Oil tank protection plans can even cover removal"
        /></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a variety of good reasons to get insurance on any aspect of
        your home, and oil tanks are no exception. Here are several large costs
        that you could incur without the benefit of oil tank protection.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Oil tank repairs:</strong>&nbsp;If your tank hasn’t been
          damaged beyond repair, the insurance company will cover the costs of
          repairing it. Depending on your policy, this could come in the form of
          having all expenses paid, or you could pay a small deductible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A new oil tank:</strong>&nbsp;If your tank does need to
          replaced, this leads to a host of new costs. Not only will you have to
          pay for the cost of a new tank, you will also be on the line for any
          installation expenses as well as the removal of your old tank.
          Insurance can go a long way (or even all the way) in covering these
          expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cleanup of property:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes, an oil tank leak
          can damage areas outside of the tank itself, including any of your
          property which might surround the tank. Cleaning this mess could be a
          hefty financial burden which is considerably lessened through an oil
          tank protection plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Replenishment of soil:</strong>&nbsp;For some outdoor tanks, a
          leak could mean nearby soil getting polluted with oil. If the tank is
          underground, all oil leakage seeps straight into the soil. Replacing
          the soil is a cost that could be covered under an oil tank protection
          plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Property value: </strong>If your policy allows, your
          protection plan might be transferrable to the next occupant of your
          property. This serves as a selling point for your property that could
          boost its value when you take it to market. Ask your insurer if this
          is included in your current plan.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Ultimately, oil tank protection plans boil down to responsibility
        on the part of a homeowner. The costs of damage to an oil tank can
        spiral out of control, and it is comforting to have peace of mind
        knowing that if you can’t cover them yourself, your insurer will be able
        to.

    <h2>Should I get an oil tank protection plan?</h2>
    <hr />
    <div>
      <p>
        Everyone should consider oil tank insurance. However, there are some
        situations which necessitate oil tank protection more than others.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>An above-ground tank:</strong>&nbsp;Any aboveground oil tank
          is exposed to the elements, especially moisture from the surrounding
          air. If the area around it is poorly ventilated, this could lead to
          corrosion and holes in the tank. Aboveground tanks are also
          susceptible to natural disasters, which could leave you with the
          additional costs of replacing a tank along with the cost of repairing
          any damage to your house. In this case, it would have been wise to
          invest in oil tank insurance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>An underground oil tank:</strong>&nbsp;Underground oil tanks
          aren’t as exposed to natural elements, but could still be damaged by
          tree roots or saturated soil, which could corrode the tank.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>An old property:</strong>&nbsp;If your home is a half century
          or more old, the oil tank that comes with it is likely also very old.
          If you don’t remember installing the tank yourself, it is important to
          invest in insurance as older tanks have higher proclivities towards
          disrepair and damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A tank for a commercial building:</strong>&nbsp;If you are
          operating in a large commercial building with multiple tenants, it is
          imperative you get insurance. This is because your liability is
          extremely high – any issues with the tank will affect not only
          yourself but also any party that leases space in your building.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A rarely used tank:</strong>&nbsp;If you live in a warmer
          climate, despite seeing less usage, your tank might actually be more
          exposed to the damage that occurs from moisture given the humid
          conditions. If the tank corrodes and eventually leaks, having
          protection will be a blessing to your wallet, and your peace of mind.
