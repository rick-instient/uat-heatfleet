    <h3>1. It doesn’t heat properly.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Not being able to effectively heat is the number one sign you need
        furnace service.</strong>&nbsp;There are a variety of factors that could cause your home
      temperature to be cold as a result of your furnace not creating hot air –
      some common ones are a clogged burner, a faulty motor, or a clogged
      filter.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Thermostat doesn’t work.</h3>
    <p>
      If you continue to feel cold despite turning up your thermostat, it might
      be time for a professional to take a look at your system. The thermostat’s
      temperature sensitive switches – which control your house’s temperature –
      could need calibrating.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, switch your furnace off and call a professional technician
      to review your furnace and thermostat.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Getting alerts from your carbon monoxide alarm.</h3>
    <p>
      If you have been hearing alerts from your carbon monoxide alarm, this is
      an emergency – call 911 and immediately turn off your furnace. Carbon
      monoxide gas can be emitted from a furnace if it has a cracked heat
      exchanger. This gas is dangerous because although it has no color or odor,
      inhalation can be deadly.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you are not hearing noises from your carbon monoxide alarm, if you
      suspect any damage to your furnace’s heat exchanger, turn it off and call
      a technician for furnace service.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Banging noises</h3>
    <p>
      If your furnace is being noisy, especially with banging or clanging
      noises, this can be a sign that it needs repair as it could be damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      One common suspect for a noisy furnace is a problem with the ignitor,
      meaning that gas builds up for a while before it is ignited. The build up
      causes a thumping noise and, over time, this delay will cause additional
      damage to your system.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Utility bills are getting more expensive</h3>
    <p>
      If your utility costs jump from month to month, it is usually a sign that
      there is an issue with your furnace. In fact, this is one of the most
      telltale signs that you need urgent furnace repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your furnace is behaving sub-optimally while the thermostat is set to
      the same target temperature, it will burn more gas, oil, or electricity
      than it normally does to maintain the load demand. This ends up being
      reflected in your end of the month energy bill.
    </p>
    <h3>7. Furnace cycles frequently</h3>
    <p>
      A furnace turning on and off frequently usually indicates an underlying
      problem with the heating system. Usually, the problem lies with a faulty
      thermostat, bad air circulation, or a clogged filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another large cause of cycling is that your furnace is too large for your
      home. An excessively large furnace has to continually stop and start to
      meet demand rather than running for longer periods of time. This
      highlights the need for professional installation from a respected
      company.

  <h2>Your boiler needs repair if:</h2>

    </p>
    <h3>1. Boiler doesn’t heat properly.</h3>
    <p>
      Just like with a furnace, your boiler needs professional care if you find
      it isn’t heating.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Boiler starts to smell funny.</h3>
    <p>
      Strange smells from your boiler are never a good sign, and sometimes
      indicate imminent danger. It is best to contact a professional as quickly
      as possible.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Boiler is leaking.</h3>
    <p>
      If your boiler is leaking, it is time to call a professional. Boiler leaks
      don’t only mean your boiler is performing inefficiently – leaks can have
      dangerous consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many homes and buildings have been uninhabitable for days due to
      complications with boiler leaks. They can end up destroying property,
      compromising structural integrity, and cause mold to start growing in your
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to take leaks seriously as leaving them could cause
      additional headaches down the road.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Your boiler is not energy efficient.</h3>
    <p>
      Similarly to furnaces, if you see energy expenditure month to month
      increasing sharply, your boiler might be in need of repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for an efficient boiler is especially pressing now, as energy
      prices across all sectors are expected to rise in the coming months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you replace a boiler, consider calling a professional to see if it
      can be tuned through relatively cheap repairs. With that said, if it
      becomes clear that your boiler is headed for disrepair, do not waste too
      many resources trying to fix it up.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Boiler takes a while to heat.</h3>
    <p>
      If you’re noticing that your boiler takes longer than usual to heat up
      your home, it is easy to write it off as the effect of colder
      temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, correctly calibrated heating systems in a home should be able to
      account for cooler temperatures and slow heating could actually be
      reflecting an issue with your boiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Call a professional for service to head off the possibility of a future
      breakdown.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Boiler’s pilot light is out.</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike the pilot light on a stove, it is unwise to try and relight an
      extinguished pilot light on a boiler yourself. Rather, call a service
      professional to prioritize your safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other warning signs related to your pilot light are the presence of oil
      stains or a yellow flame. Both of these indicate deeper issues that
      require repair.
    </p>
    <h3>8. Uneven heating.</h3>
    <p>
      If one half of a room seems noticeably colder than the other half, or vice
      versa, it is likely your boiler could be experiencing an issue. Call a
      technician to make sure everything is running smoothly with your heating
      system.
    </p>
    <h3>9. Boiler is making noises.</h3>
    <p>
      A hiss-like sound from your boiler usually means a deposit is forming in
      it. This usually isn’t a major issue – a professional service will be able
      to easily clean your boiler and provide general maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you leave your boiler untreated this could allow the deposits
      to accumulate and end up causing costly repairs or boiler failure in the
      long term.
