      </p>
      <p>
        In the New England area, the average oil tank is around 275 gallons.
        While this is ideal for keeping homes heated through the cold winter,
        the volume of liquid means spillage can be a real issue. To make matters
        worse, tanks are often in isolated areas of the house such as in the
        corner of a basement, which can delay the detection of leaks for days or
        weeks. How can you spot a leak an oil tank leak in your home?
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing to check for is a damp spot on the bottom of the tank,
        sometimes near the seam. As the oil tank leak gets worse, the wetness
        will migrate up into the sides of the tank. The tank may also develop an
        oily smell. If the leak goes unnoticed for a while, dark icicle-shaped
        deposits may form on the bottom the oil tank. As these deposits grow,
        the floor underneath the tank will begin to be stained, usually a redder
        black color. An oil stain may also develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;If you notice any of the signs of an oil tank leak, it is
        important to immediately report them to your oil dealer. In some states,
        by law, oil spills must be reported to the Fire Department which
        subsequently reports to the state Department of Environmental
        Protection. Not reporting a spill could lead to fines and environmental
        consequences.

      <h2>Steps to Handle An Indoor Oil Tank Leak</h2>
      <hr />
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Call the fire department:&nbsp;</strong>As mentioned
            previously, any of the signs of an oil leak mean the fire department
            needs to be called. Oil can quickly catch fire, causing combustion
            which could lead to additional damage and complications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ventilate the oil tank leak:</strong>&nbsp;Open any windows
            around the site of the leak and set up fans to blow fumes away.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blockade the leak:</strong>&nbsp;Do not let anybody,
            especially children, expose themselves to the leak.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure your family’s health:</strong>&nbsp;In extreme cases,
            an oil leak can lead to health risks. Vapors can induce headaches,
            dizziness, nausea, and disorientation. The longer the exposure, the
            worse the symptoms. Relocating your family for a few days could be a
            smart decision until the spill is cleaned up. The urgency of the
            situation increases if you have small children or elderly relatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilize an oil cleanup contractor:</strong>&nbsp;The oil
            tank will need to be repaired or replaced. You will need to contract
            a professional to advise you, carry out repairs, and recommend
            installing a new tank if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check your insurance policy:</strong>&nbsp;It is possible
            your homeowner’s insurance covers oil spills. By contacting your
            insurance company you can make sure you are covered and
            <a

              >extend your coverage</a

            if you don’t already have it in your policy.&nbsp;

      <h2>Fixing An Outdoor Oil Tank Leak:</h2>
      <hr />
      <div>
        <p>
          It’s a little harder to see an outdoor oil tank leaking, but look for
          the same signs as an indoor tank and utilize the following steps.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Take a soil sample.</strong>&nbsp;An environmental expert
            will help you analyze a soil sample from around your tank. The
            presence of any oil in this sample likely means you have an oil tank
            leak.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contact a tank removal contractor.&nbsp;</strong>Just like
            with an indoor tank, cleaning up is a job best left to a
            professional. Collect references from neighbors if your heating oil
            provider doesn’t cover tank removal or cleanup.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remove the tank.</strong>&nbsp;Unlike an indoor tank, a
            contractor will have to remove the tank. A buried outdoor tank is
            impossible to repair cleanly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Call the fire department.&nbsp;</strong>Again, it is
            important to report the spill for both the environment’s sake and
            for your own financial sake.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Determine the severity of the oil leak.</strong>&nbsp;A
            contractor will likely figure out the extent of your oil tank leak
            the day they clean it up. It is important to make sure no fuel has
            leaked into the water table. This is verified through soil analysis
            both above and below your tank, as well as to the sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contact your insurance company</strong>. If your insurance
            has a clause that covers oil spills, you might be contacted by an
            adjuster who will review your property and the findings from the
            contractor who cleaned up. In some cases, the insurance company may
            handle any additional cleanup themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean up the mess.</strong>&nbsp;If your water table is
            undamaged and the insurance company is not involved further, you
            will need a contractor to fill the void left by the tank with fresh
            soil. An analysis of said soil will be conducted to make sure it is
            up to state standards. The mess should also be cleaned up completely
            – your backyard should look as it did pre-spill.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the paperwork.</strong>&nbsp;Whoever cleaned the mess
            will file a No Further Action letter with the state and give you a
            copy which you should keep secure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Oil Tank Leak Prevention</h2>
      <hr />

      <div>
        <p>
          It is important to secure your tank to prevent a recurring or
          first-time oil tank leak.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Protect the fuel oil lines that run from the tank to the furnace
              by putting concrete over them or wrapping them in tubing.</strong
            >
            This will help avoid leaks from damage to your lines as well as
            further complications from faulty lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tighten and clean all pipe connections.</strong>
            Instructions for installing piping can be found here – follow the
            directions to avoid spillage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor your fuel usage.</strong>&nbsp;If you seem to be
            using significantly more fuel than you have in years past, it might
            be time to do some investigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check up on the fuel tank and the lines</strong>. Tanks
            older than 20 years old should be heavily considered for
            replacement, even if you can’t physically see anything wrong with
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor tank legs.</strong>&nbsp;Check the tank legs to make
            sure they are not bent and are still holding the tank upright.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schedule maintenance.</strong>&nbsp;Yearly maintenance,
            generally before the cold weather begins, is recommended. Oil tank
            leaks can be avoided through recurring maintenance and efficiency
            can be ensured.&nbsp;
          </li>
