                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using the map below, find your climate zone’s Required Heating
                    Power, measured as BTUs per Square Foot.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Using the Correction Factor table below, find your home’s Correction
                    Factor.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Multiply your home’s square feet by the Required Heating Power (from
                    Step 1), and multiply that by the<br>Correction Factor (from Step 2) to find your
                    recommended boiler&nbsp;size.</p>

                    <li>
                        Air Infiltration: A drafty building is hard to heat. Make sure there are no gaps in the
                        doors or windows of the building.</li>
                    <li>House Floorplan: In general, it is harder to heat longer, narrower homes than shorter,
                        squarer homes.</li>
                    <li>Ceiling Height: If the ceiling is more than 14’ high, install ceiling fans to
                        re-circulate the heat from the ceiling down onto the floor area.</li>
                    <li>Heat Recovery: If the garage doors are left open a lot or opened and closed frequently
                        you may need a more powerful heating unit.
